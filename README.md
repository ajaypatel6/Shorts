# Shorts
A social-media like app that allows users to create stories and have those stories be viewed on the dashboard at random, (favoring newer stories)

Application created with Android Studio, using Kotlin , Cloud Firestore NoSQL database.

# What I did
This was my first application I created with Kotlin. It seems very efficient in comparison to Java and i could see how development with it would be faster.

Using cloud firestore was good, it helped with user authentication and has good support for its database and allowed me to see a NoSQL database and how it works.
